# Don't merge my WIPs!

*Note:* Only works for [Github](https://github.com).

This Chrome plugin warns you if you have WIPs (Work-In-Progress commits) in your pull request before merging.
* Warns you when you view a pull request with WIPs.
* Warns you and attempts to preempt JS execution when you try to merge a pull request with WIPs.

Feel free to clone and modify however you like.
